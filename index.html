		<h1>Movies I've Seen Recently</h1>
		<div class="column1of2">
			<h3>C'Mon C'Mon</h3>
			<p> In a movie discord called The Locomotion Picture, they host these themed roulette movie events where I
            am partnered with another member in the server and we reccomend each other movies based on a one word theme
            that is supposed to be broad.</p>
			<p>Love was the theme last week and I reccomended this film called Moonlight and
            they reccommended me C'Mon C'Mon which is about the growing relationship between this man and his uncle. I 
            don't normally like children in the films that I've seen but this nephew was so speaking so inteligent about
            the most random topics.</p>
			<h3>Zombies 2</h3>
			<p>In this second movie discord server I'm in, they do a roulette movie event but with no theme. I was
            reccomended Zombies 2 because this person saw on my letterboxd that I enjoyed the first one. So they took the chance. 
            Personally I don't think we need sequels anymore or even third and fourth installments but I did have a fun time
            although the storyline was such a turn off for me to say the least</p>
